<br>
Do we dare invade the solemn assembly of the birds on the fence waiting 
expectantly for the democratic primary?&nbsp; I’m really not surprised that Hillary 
and Obama are front runners.&nbsp; I will hold my comments on Obama till later, but I 
must open my mouth and strike my pen to paper.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Herein lies a curse of no minute proportions.&nbsp; God’s people are warned of 
judgment in Isaiah 3, and one of the judgments was that “children are their 
oppressors and women rule over them” (V. 12).&nbsp; In verses 1-3, God promises to 
take food, water, mighty men, men of war, judge, prophet, prudent and the 
ancient, the captain of fifty, honorable, counselor, cunning artificer and the 
eloquent orator.<br>
<br>
Can we not see this prophecy coming true in America as well?&nbsp; Could it be that 
we have digressed so much that we would elect a woman as the leader of the 
greatest nation on earth?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Men are under attack in this country more than ever before.&nbsp; They are ridiculed, 
defamed, denounced, accused and rejected; then children, novices, women and 
imbeciles take their place, to the applause and approval of most people. Why do 
we not want <strong>men</strong>?&nbsp; Why do we gravitate to effeminacy?&nbsp; The 
answer is so simple it’s inescapable.&nbsp; The actions of Romans 1: 21-32 are being 
repeated again:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; V.21 - They relegate God to a creation of their own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; V.22 - Profess themselves to be wise, they become fools<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; V.23 - Change the glory of the incorruptible God into the image of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; V.25 - Change the truth of God into a lie (numerous translations)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; V.27 - Sodomites proliferate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; V.28 - Will not retain God in their knowledge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; V.28 (b) - They are turned over to reprobate minds<br>
<br>
Sad, but judgment is not coming, it is happening NOW.<br>
<br>
Women ‘preachers’ have mounted pulpits and have become extremely popular with 
many so-called Bible believers (not Bible <em>students</em>).&nbsp; Those&nbsp; who are 
not following women are following novices and hirelings.&nbsp; I always said the 
average assembly does not want a man in the pulpit, but a novice or a novelty.&nbsp; 
Translated, that means an ignoramus or a clown, and most have succeeded in 
getting just what they want. So, as the houses of worship have yielded to the 
spirit of feminism, so our nation may soon do the same.&nbsp; God spare us this 
shame.&nbsp; Even if Mrs. Clinton were a deserving lady, she still has no place in 
the presidency, or for that matter, in her present office.<br>
<br>
I would be highly disappointed if she won the election but not surprised, for 
Americans are easily bamboozled by rhetoric from a woman.&nbsp; Mrs. Clinton has high 
hopes, but pray for God to have mercy and spare us the embarrassment and circus 
antics that would prevail if she were to become Mrs. President.&nbsp; Every man in 
America should stand against such a thing!&nbsp; Well though, I guess every <strong>
MAN</strong> will!&nbsp; What a shame to all America that she even has a chance at 
the White House.<br>
