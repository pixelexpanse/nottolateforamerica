                          your house is on the sand.<br>
                          <br>
                          Our <b>children</b> wander aimlessly<br>
                          poisoned by cocaine<br>
                          choosing to indulge their lusts,<br>
                          when God has said abstain<br>

                          From <b>sea</b> to shining sea,<br>
                          our Nation turns away<br>
                          From the teaching of God's love<br>
                          and a need to always pray.<br>
                          <br>
                          We've kept <b>God</b> in our temples,<br>
                          how callous we have grown.<br>
                          When earth is but His footstool,<br>
                          and Heaven is His throne.<br>
                          <br>
                          We've voted in a <b>government</b><br>
                          that's rotting at the core,<br>
                          Appointing Godless Judges;<br>
                          who throw reason out the door,<br>
                          <br>
                          Too soft to place a <b>killer</b><br>
                          in a well deserved tomb,<br>
                          But brave enough to kill a baby<br>
                          before he leaves the womb.<br>
                          <br>
                          You think that <b>God's</b> not angry,<br>
                          that our land's a moral slum?<br>
                          How much longer will He wait<br>
                          before His judgment comes?<br>
                          <br>
                          How are we to face our <b>God</b>,<br>
                          from Whom we cannot hide?<br>
                          What then is left for us to do,<br>
                          but stem this evil tide?<br>
                          <br>
                          If we who are His <b>children</b>,<br>
                          will humbly turn and pray;<br>
                          Seek His holy face<br>
                          and mend our evil way:<br>
                          <br>
                          Then <b>God will hear from Heaven;<br>
                          and forgive us of our sins,</b><br>
                          He'll heal our sickly land<br>
