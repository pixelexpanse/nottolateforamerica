  <font face="Courier New" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt">People like 
  Cindy Sheehan are ignorant. Not just to this war, but to the results of their 
  idiotic ramblings, or at least I hope they are. They don't realize its effects 
  on this war. In this war, there are no Geneva Conventions, no cease fires. 
  Medics and Chaplains are not spared from the enemy's brutality because it's 
  against the rules. I can only imagine the horrors a military Chaplain would 
  experience at the hands of the enemy. The enemy slinks in the shadows and 
  fights a coward's war against us. It is effective though, as many men and 
  women have died since the start of this war. And the memory of their service 
  to
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">
  <st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> is tainted by 
  the inconsiderate remarks on our nation's news outlets. And every day, the 
  enemy changes...only now, the enemy is becoming something new. The enemy is 
  transitioning from the Muslim extremists to Americans. The enemy is becoming 
  the very people whom we defend with our lives. And they do not realize it.</span></font></div>

  <font face="Courier New" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt">It is 
  absolutely sickening to me to think our country has come to this. Why are we 
  so obsessed with the bad news? Why will people stop at nothing to be against 
  this war, no matter how much evidence of the good we've done is thrown in 
  their face? When is the last time CNN or MSNBC or CBS reported the opening of 
  schools and hospitals in
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">
  <st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> ? Or the leaders of 
  terror cells being detained or killed? It's all happening, but people will not 
  let up their hatred of Bush. They will ignore the good news, because it just 
  might show people that Bush was right. </span></font>

  has lost its will to fight. It has lost its will to defend what is right and 
  just in the world. The crazy thing of it all is that the American people have 
  not even been asked to sacrifice a single thing. It's not like World War Two, 
  where people rationed food, and turned in cars to be made into metal for 
  tanks. The American people have not been asked to sacrifice anything. Unless 
  you are in the military or the family member of a service member, its life as 
  usual...the war doesn't affect you.

  be then? Where will the Cindy Sheehans be to comfort and talk to soldiers and 
  help them sort out the last couple years of their lives, most of which have 
  been spent dodging death and wading through the deaths of their friends? They 
  will be where they always are, somewhere far away, where the horrors of the 
  world can't touch them. Somewhere where they can complain about things they 
  will never experience in their lifetime; things that the young men and women

  live on, rebuild and prosper. And

  our military alone. We must all stand up and fight, whether in uniform or not.
