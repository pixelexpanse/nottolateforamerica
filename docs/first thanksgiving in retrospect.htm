First Thanksgiving in Retrospect</b></span></p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-weight: normal">By Jim Hethcox</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">We have all heard of and studied the celebration 
of the first Thanksgiving and the events that led up to this festival of 
thanksgiving to God by the Pilgrims.&nbsp; They left England on September 6, 1620 and 
after two months of storm-tossed seas, they landed at Plymouth Rock in present 
day Massachusetts.&nbsp; After reaching Plymouth Rock they had a prayer service and 
then began to construct crude shelters.&nbsp; Ill prepared for the harsh winter, 
nearly half of the party died before spring.&nbsp; It wasn’t until the following 
December, in1621 that they decided to celebrate a three day festival dedicated 
to God for his good Providence and bounty during that summer’s growing season.&nbsp; 
Thus began the tradition we know today as Thanksgiving. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">However, that was not the first Thanksgiving, 
but the one that derived the current tradition of Thanksgiving in America.&nbsp; 
Actually, the first Thanksgiving celebration occurred in Virginia in 1608 some 
twelve years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.&nbsp; Captain John Woodlief 
conducted that thanksgiving service.&nbsp; Captain Woodlief was the Captain of the 
good ship Margaret that had just brought many early settlers to present day 
Virginia.&nbsp; So, contrary to traditional belief, the first Thanksgiving was 
actually conducted in Virginia in 1608, not in Massachusetts in 1621.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Just recently I have learned, through a detailed 
genealogical search, of my own link to some of these first settlers.&nbsp; Captain 
John Woodlief was my 11<sup>th</sup> great grandfather.&nbsp; Another interesting 
character in that early crossing was Richard Pace.&nbsp; Richard Pace, my 10<sup>th</sup> 
great grandfather, was an early plantation owner and patriot of the new world.&nbsp; 
His plantation was known as Pace’s Paines and lay across the James River from 
Jamestown.&nbsp; He learned of an impending Indian attack in 1622 through an Indian 
servant and rowed his boat across the James River to warn Jamestown of the 
impending danger.&nbsp; He later received a letter of commendation acknowledging his 
efforts.&nbsp; The Indians did attack in what is known in history books as the 
Jamestown Massacre of 1622, but Pace’s warning no doubt saved many lives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Richard Pace’s 3<sup>rd</sup> great 
granddaughter, Amy Pace, married Solomon Strickland in 1764.&nbsp; Solomon Strickland 
is reported to have been a six foot six redhead that served under General Elijah 
Clark during the American Revolutionary War.&nbsp; Solomon Strickland was my 5<sup>th</sup> 
great grandfather. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Another of my early ancestors was Richard 
Braswell, Solomon Strickland’s great grandfather.&nbsp; He was the Rector of the 
first English speaking Church in the new world, called St. Luke’s Church, near 
Smithfield, Virginia (the first being a Spanish mission in St. Augustine, 
Florida).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">I couldn’t help but ponder what those earliest 
Americans would think of the modern version of the Thanksgiving holiday and the 
nation that they settled and founded.&nbsp; I’m sure that in many ways they would be 
surprised to see the growth and blessings that God has shown to this great 
land.&nbsp; They couldn’t have imagined the magnitude of the great expanse known as 
North America.&nbsp; But, I do believe they would be heart-broken as they surveyed 
the spiritual decline and moral decay in the America of our day.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">I wonder what they would write if they could pen 
their comments in a letter to the editor of the local newspaper.&nbsp; What 
observations would they make concerning the state of affairs of the nation 
today?&nbsp; Would they look around and find that this land, to which they had sought 
refuge from religious and political persecution, had itself become a land where 
God Himself was a stranger?&nbsp; We see the fruits of the godlessness of this nation 
when we hear people wish each other a Happy Turkey-Day, as if we were somehow 
celebrating the turkey.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, they turn their holiday attention to feasting, 
football games, and hunting.&nbsp; How many families will gather around a table 
overflowing with wonderful delicacies and begin filling their mouths without 
even stopping to say, thank you Lord for your many blessings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Since September 11, 2001 our national prayer has 
been, God Bless America.&nbsp; Have we become so spiritually blind that it escapes us 
that God has indeed blessed America abundantly since those first colonists 
settled?&nbsp; Or, is it that we have forgotten how to pray and the best we can 
muster in the form of a prayer is a borrowed line from an old song, God Bless 
America.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if this bumper-sticker prayer of today’s America might be 
more appropriate if it was a cry for, God to bless America with revival, and 
bless us with conviction of our sins, and bless us with godly leaders of our 
land, and most of all, God bless us with godly families.&nbsp; Christian families 
where the mother and father are together, raising their children in the nurture 
and admonition of the Lord.&nbsp; That would be a prayer worth praying and one that 
would see immediate positive results.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">We Americans have so much to be thankful for but 
we don’t even know Him to whom thanks is due.&nbsp; We have come to the place in our 
history where we can now say that we are living in a post-Christian era.&nbsp; I have 
observed that there is a lot of religion in America today but not much true 
spirituality and not much Biblical truth.&nbsp; We have forgotten our God and 
Savior.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 16.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Arial">In retrospect, I don’t believe we have much in 
common with those early Christian settlers from which we sprang.&nbsp; They trusted 
God to supply all their need and depended on him daily as a way of life.&nbsp; God 
help us to break with our secular culture and cease from worshipping at the 
altar of materialism!&nbsp; And, may I say, <b><font size="5">“America, Bless God”
</font></b>as we turn back to Him during this holy holiday of Thanksgiving to 
our Sovereign God. </span></p>
